- - When can an apprentice receive a Confirmation of In-School Training (AIG) Letter?
  - Confirmation of In-School Training letter(s) • Client's program/trade must be designated red-seal in Ontario. • Only issued for completion of level 1 and level 2. Client must have a Training Agreement in the status of 'Registered' Client must not have an 'Active' OYAP Status (OYAP clients are not eligible for these letters) Refer to Service Canad's website for more information on AIG eligibility and requirements. • If the client's Level and associated Reportable Subjects are exempted by reason of 'Completed through earlier curriculum version', then the system will not generate the letter.
- - Why hasn't the system generated the Confirmation of In-School Training (AIG) Letter?
  - If you are completing a client's apprenticeship program on the same week that they have finished schooling, or if you are completing a client's apprenticeship program and also exempting them from schooling, this will conflict with one of the rules above (TA status must be 'Registered'), and the system will not generate the letter(s). It is recommended that you wait until the following week to complete the apprentice, to ensure that the system generates/issues the letter(s). We are in the process of implementing an enhancement to the system, so that it can support this business practice, and allow for the letters to be generated as well.
- - The client states that they have established an active apprentice class membership with OCOT, however their membership status does not reflect this in the Program Participation page.
  - Navigate to the originating PDC and click on the Financial tab.Then, click on the Over and Under Payments section of the screen. In certain scenarios, an apprentice may confirm that they have established an 'Active' OCOT Membership and have a Training Agreement in 'Registered' status, however on their EOIS-APPR client record, the OCOT Membership status for the particular program may still be 'Pending', 'Cancelled', or 'Not registered'. What this means, is that OCOT may have failed to send us Interface Event 7 (E7), which is responsible for updating this status on the client's EOIS-APPR record. Here are the steps that you should take":" 1. Inform your Regional Apprenticeship leads of this problem. (E.g. Eastern Region":" Roberta Barrette & Rosemary Young) 2. Your Regional Apprenticeship leads must inform OCOT of this discrepancy, and should have them verify that the client's membership is in good standing, and then send the Interface Event (E7) which is responsible for updating the membership status on the client's EOIS-APPR record. Note":" In EOIS-APPR, the OCOT Membership status is relevant for Apprenticeship programs (Apprentice class membership), but is irrelevant for Certification programs (Journeypersons class membership).
- - How do I apply an exam block for a client, if OCOT has requested to do so?  - The scenario is that OCOT places an exam block on a client's record (due to an investigation or required upgrading, etc.) If the client has as existing exam credit, then you would schedule the client to an exam sitting, and then apply a block (Refer to EOIS-APPR User Manual":" Chapter 10 - Section 10.6). If the client does not have an exam credit, you can cancel the client's status for the applicable Certification program (Program Participation status). You must ensure that you leave an appropriate status change note, before saving the change. (E.g. Client has been blocked from writing 310T exam, as per OCOT. This program will be re-activated upon confirmation from OCOT.)
- - Do OCOT and MAESD share contact information or address changes?
  - Any subsequent changes to contact information and address information are not shared between OCOT and MAESD. However,at the point that OCOT sends us a new Certification program for the client (if applicable) the address will be updated if it is different in OCOT's database. When a client updates their address with the Ministry, it is recommended that they also contact OCOT to update their address.
- - A client has stated that they are a Journeyperson however in APPR their Journeyperson's class membership status shows as 'Pending'. What explains this?
  - The OCOT public registry should be the source for Journeyperson membership validation, not APPR. APPR does not receive updates regarding Journeypersons class membership status.
- - APPR indicates that OCOT changed the client's TA status to 'Suspension Proposed'. How is this possible, since it is our understanding that this can only be done by MAESD staff?
  - OCOT will suspend both the client's membership status, and training agreement status, if the client does not pay their renewal fee. Once unsuspended by OCOT, these statuses will return to what they were before. A TA status of 'Registered' is not always the case. In this particular case, OCOT returned the TA status from 'Suspended' back to 'Suspension Proposed'. Note":" After a Ministry user changes a client's TA status from 'Registered' to 'Suspension Proposed' a letter is sent to the client the following week. The system will change the status to 'Suspended' after 45 days, if no further action is taken. (E.g. ETC returns the TA status back to 'Registered' after consultation with client, or perhaps new RTA has been inputted, and this current TA gets cancelled) This would be a scenario where the Ministry changed the TA status from 'Registered' to 'Suspension Proposed', however within the 45 days window, OCOT initiates their own suspension, which cause the TA status to move from 'Suspension Proposed' to 'Suspended' before the 45 day window. When OCOT un-suspends/re-activates the clients membership, the system returns the TA status back to what it was previously. (I.e. Suspension Proposed). The 45 day window will reset and if the client does not contact the Ministry within the next 45 days, the TA status will be changed to 'Suspended', however keep in mind, this time it would be a Ministry initiated suspension. Note":" Letters are generated and sent to the client when their TA status moves to 'Suspension Proposed' or 'Suspended' with instructions to contact either OCOT or the Ministry.
- - What is the process that should be followed when duplicate client records are identified in APPR?
  - Verify that both client records do in fact belong to the same client. Notify the EOIS Service Desk via AskEOIS@ontario.ca and we can put in a request to have the records merged. In addition, we may recommend workarounds, in scenarios where the client is waiting to register a new training agreement, or where the client needs to be scheduled to a C/Q exam, and other various scenarios where we do not want to prevent the client from moving forward.
- - Why does the client's (Apprenticeship) Program Participation status show as 'Approval Pending Completed Training'?
  - The system will change the client's program participation status from 'Active' to 'Approval Pending Completed Training' if it has recognized that a user has completed the client's training agreement, and that all reportable subjects / schooling have been completed. A work item will also be created and assigned to the applicable local office. It is meant to remind the user that they have forgotten a key step in the process of completing client's apprenticeship program. A user must then update the program participation status to 'Completed Training' by using the page action 'Complete training for the selected program'. Once this step has been completed, the system will generate/issue the Certificate of Apprenticeship. Alternatively, the system will also change the client's program participation status to 'Approval Pending Completed Training' even if the client does not have a training agreement in 'Completed' status. The system recognizes that all program hours have been signed-off across all cancelled training agreements, or it will recognize that all skill-sets have been completed, and that all reportable subjects/schooling has been completed. The ETC must verify if the client is eligible for completion, and can then update the program participation status from 'Approval Pending Completed Training' to 'Completed Training' using the same page action noted above. Note":" When completing a client's apprenticeship program without a 'Completed' training agreement, please follow business practice in regards to notifying OCOT about the client's completion. Currently, the system is setup to notify OCOT of a client's completion when the TA status is updated from 'Registered' to 'Completed'. This information is then electronically sent to OCOT overnight via an Interface event. Changes may be implemented in the future so that we can notify OCOT of client's who complete their program without a completed training agreement.
